                                    <li>Do you share my information through Epic Care Everywhere, CareQuality, or other HIE systems?</li>

                                    <li><strong>Provider HIE Sharing:</strong> Opt out of Epic Care Everywhere, CareQuality, and state HIEs</li>
                                    <li><strong>Medicare Shared Savings Program:</strong> Ask if your providers participate and opt out if possible</li>

                                    <li>Review any care management programs you're enrolled in</li>
                                    <li>Consider supplemental insurance privacy policies</li>
                                    <li>Be aware that basic Medicare claims data will still be collected</li>

                                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot completely avoid federal health records if you use Medicare benefits. The goal is to minimize <em>additional</em> sharing beyond what's required for billing and basic program administration.</p>

                                    <li>You may need to bring medical records to new appointments</li>
                                    <li>Providers might need to repeat some tests if they can't access previous results</li>
                                    <li>You'll need to be more proactive in sharing relevant medical history</li>
                                    <li>Coordination between specialists might require more effort on your part</li>

                                    <li>Request records from previous providers when seeing new ones</li>
                                    <li>Consider a personal health record app or folder</li>

                                <p>Here's how to verify your opt-out was successful:</p>
                                
                                <h4>Request Written Confirmation:</h4>

                                    <li>Ask for written confirmation from each provider's Privacy Officer</li>

                                <h4>Test Your Opt-Out Status:</h4>

                                    <li>When visiting a new provider, ask if they can see your records from other systems</li>

                                <p>This is a crucial distinction that many people find confusing:</p>
                                
                                <h4>HIPAA (Federal Law):</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Allows</strong> sharing for "treatment, payment, and healthcare operations" without your consent</li>
                                    <li>Covers how your existing provider handles your information</li>
                                    <li>Requires you to be notified about privacy practices</li>
                                    <li>Does NOT require consent for most HIE sharing</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>HIE Opt-Out (State Laws):</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Restricts</strong> sharing beyond the immediate provider relationship</li>
                                    <li>Covers electronic sharing with other healthcare systems</li>
                                    <li>Requires providers to honor your opt-out preference</li>
                                    <li>Goes beyond HIPAA's baseline protections</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Key Takeaway:</h4>
                                <p>HIPAA actually <em>permits</em> most HIE sharing, while state HIE opt-out laws give you the right to <em>prevent</em> that sharing. You need HIE opt-out procedures, not just HIPAA requests.</p>
